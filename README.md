**Football Data Analysis**

Gone are the days where the game of football was played purely based of on-field instincts. Literally every sports team makes use of historical data to devise strategy/tactics.
Football is no exception, Eventhough the game is won only by the on-field performance there is a huge role of data analysis which decides the gameplay to certain extent. In this project we are making use of data collected by OneSport covering 2012/13 season to 2016/17 season of European club football.

Analysing data helps in better preparation for a game. Players like Lionel Messi are well known for free-kick conversion off late. Players stand at near post,far post,even lie down behind the wall to stop him from scoring. But in case of open play only with the help of data analysis one can figure out which spot he has gone for at what frequency. It also helps in understanding which teams can be lot more physical with the yellow cards and red card history.

Overall, data analysis has a fair share of its say in a football game. Teams do their homework before every single tie thanks to data analysis and data visualisation.
